ros-melodic-nodelet (1.9.8-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Fix bond handling during nodelet unloading (#51 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/51>)
    * add test whether bond breaking on unload works (tests #50 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/50>)
    * disable callback for broken bond when we are breaking it
    This avoids the nodelet::LoaderROS::unload() method to be called
    twice for the same nodelet, causing an error output.
    * use AsyncSpinner for nodelet load in order for the shutdown procedure to work
    During shutdown, the bonds still need to communicate their status in order
    for the nodelet to properly/cleanly/quickly unload. This requires the node
    to spin.
    * add test whether LoaderROS::unload() is called twice (tests #50 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/50>)

  * adding nodelet_core metapackage and reving to 1.7.1

ros-melodic-nodelet (1.7.0-0stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * fix dependencies
  * make it compile locally
  * first pass at catkinizing the stack
  * updated to latest pluginlib
  * updated usage of pluginlib according to updated REP 121
  * use updated pluginlib to auto-unload libraries when unloading nodelets
  * fixed issue #5144 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/5144> on OS X lion
  * Commentary on who owns what among Loader, Nodelet, CallbackQueue and CallbackQueueManager.
  * Moved most of Loader's member variables into an opaque PIMPL struct so we can change things without breaking ABI.
  * All bond code moved to LoaderROS. Loader no longer needs to know about bond.
  * Removed CallbackQueue::disable(). Loader removes a nodelet's queues from the queue manager when unloading it, which is sufficient to prevent new callbacks for that nodelet getting added.
  * Removed some code and comments concerned with callbacks getting called after their nodelet's destruction. This can't actually happen anymore, since callbacks only fire if they can lock a weak_ptr to their parent nodelet.
  * Refactoring to streamline Nodelet back down to a simple plugin interface. It no longer knows about detail::CallbackQueue[Manager] or Bond; init() simply takes the single- and multi-threaded ros::CallbackQueueInterface* instead (defaulting to NULL). Loader owns the callback queues and bond for each nodelet. This makes it possible to use Nodelet without all the surrounding infrastructure.
  * Take Bond pointers as const-ref instead of value in Loader and Nodelet.
  * Added Loader constructor taking a boost::function object used as a factory for
    nodelet instances, replacing the default use of a pluginlib class loader. This
    is to support ROSGUI, which defines its specialized plugin interface as a
    subclass of Nodelet, and thus needs a different class loader.
  * Removed some debug code in Loader constructor.
  * 'nodelet load' more reliably unloads the nodelet on exiting. In particular it intercepts XML-RPC shutdown command, used for example by 'rosnode kill'.
  * Enabled error output when service calls fail abnormally.
  * Rewrote tracked_object logic to be clearer.
  * Have detail::CallbackQueue use a ros::VoidConstWPtr as the tracked object, which is now optional. More generic, and fixes test_nodelet which was broken by the last commit.
  * Fixed race conditions/deadlocks when unloading a nodelet. Now disable the nodelet's callback queues before deleting it. The queues have a WPtr to the nodelet, so any outstanding callbacks will get discarded.
  * ~Loader now stops callback manager threads before destroying the nodelets. Otherwise the worker threads could operate on nodelet data as/after it's destroyed.
  * Use ros::names::parentNamespace().
  * Cleaned scoped_ptr's out of ThreadInfo and updated its padding.
  * Made ThreadInfo::calling an atomic_count. This allows the manager thread to pick the queue with least work more accurately, and reduces contention b/c getSmallestQueue no longer needs to lock on ``queue_mutex_``.
  * Minor code cleanup and finer locking in managerThread().
  * Actually pad ThreadInfo to a multiple of 64 bytes. Previous expression was wrongly wrapped in sizeof().
  * Instead of ``thread_info_``.resize(num_threads), push each ThreadInfo on individually. With resize(), all threads ended up sharing the same queue_mutex and queue_cond. Doesn't seem to be much of a performance win though.
  * Added test instrumentation to CallbackQueueManager to track size of worker thread queues over time. Must be enabled at compilation time with -DNODELET_QUEUE_DEBUG.
  * nodelet patches for osx lion support from wjwwood
  * Added --no-bond option to nodelet loading to disable bonds.
  * updated platform tags
  * don't need to link against tinyxml directly
  * link against system tinyxml
  * Fix for #4855 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4855>
    This fix actually makes sense, but that it wasn't caught earlier
    doesn't.  The construction of
    nodelet::Loader n(false)
    was creating the first node handle and letting it go out of scope,
    which was automagically calling ros::shutdown(), which is a dumb thing
    for ros::NodeHandle to do automagically on destruction.
  * Each nodelet now places its bonds on a custom callback queue
  * a script to list declared nodelets
  * real fix for #4460 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4460>
  * patch for #4460 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4460>
  * adding support for once, throttle, and filter features.  With unit tests for all but the filters #4681 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4681>
  * fix for #4609 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4609>
  * MUX simplified by using a 8-connected null filters
    DeMUX has a specialization for message type (uses ros::Subscriber internally by default)
    Added rosdep for nodelet (uuid)
  * adding optional namespace aware constructor to nodelet loader. #4243 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4243> and fixing vestigial comments referencing Filters #4221 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4221>
  * nodelet uses bond to handle crashes on the manager or the spawner end.  #4221 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4221>
  * locking in all cases
  * fix hang on CallbackQueueManager destruction (#4402 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4402>)
  * better check for services
  * fix hanging tests and a hang on nodelet CallbackQueueManager destruction (#4082 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4082>)
  * added a boost mutex
  * preventing nodelets from busywaiting
  * Added optional parameter num_worker_threads to nodelets.
  * Added Ubuntu platform tags to manifest
  * implemented nodelet unloading on shutdown
  * fixed a segfault on destroy
  * merging josh's branch from ticket #3875 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/3875>
  * adding usage
  * fancy new command line parsing for nodelets #3876 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/3876>
  * moving topic tools out of nodelet proper, removing rospy and message_filters dependencies from nodelet
  * doc updates
  * fixed a segfault
  * small changes (ptr->boost shared_ptr)

  * nodelet_internal_init is now private and a friend of NodeletLoader
  * nodelet API changes
  * COND rosconsole Nodelet wrappers working
